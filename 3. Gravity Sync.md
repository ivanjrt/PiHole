This is to have a High Availability PiHole server,  <br/>
the switch doesn't happen automatically but is always in-sync with the main Pi-hole for all settings except for DCHP <br/>
ps. this Repo doesn't cover pihole with DHCP because PfSense takes care of that. <br/> <br/>

# Check for requirements:
* Install Pihole and its SSH Sever 
* Add the the final IPs the will be assigned to
* check for these Applications that needs to be installed:
 ```
 sudo apt install git rsync ssh sqlite3
 ```
 * Edit this file:
 ```sudo EDITOR=nano visudo```
 #comment out %sudo ALL(ALL:ALL) and add this line: 
 ```
 pihole ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
 ```

 where pihole is the user name with admin rights, This process will omit the password input everytime he puts sudo in the begining. <br/>
 then reboot ```sudo reboot```
# Run the installer for Gravity sync:
* from the Main Pihole first, then the secondary after
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmstan/gs-install/main/gs-install.sh | bash
```
Then just add yes to secure the connection, it should look like this: <br/>
it will ask you for the IP of the secondary PiHole and the username, and at the end it will run its first sync and will show result<br/>

# Time to test things out, add a rule block in the main pihole:
 * `gravity-sync compare`
 * `gravity-sync push` it will push from itself to the remote pihole
 * `gravity-sync pull` it will pull from itself to the remote pihole
 * `gravity-sync` both
 * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44326428/218904300-9557ef44-438a-4f55-aa59-a2f07c2d84b1.png)
and it should foward that blocklist

# To automate it 
```
gravity-sync auto quad
```
from the Master, which will sync every 15 Mins, although no sure so, I did this: <br/>
```crontab -e``` <br/>
and Added this at the end <br/>

I'm doing every 8 hrs just in case I need to fix something, so it wont spread as fast enough time to fix it before a Restore OS <br/>
```
0 */8 * * * /bin/bash gravity-sync push
```

Notes: <br/>
to update gravity sync: <br/>
```
gravity-sync version
gravity-sync update
```
